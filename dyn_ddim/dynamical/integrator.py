class RK4Integrator(object):
    """
    RK4Integrator uses a Runge-Kutta fourth-order method to integrate given
    model function in time. This method calculates four different states, which
    are then averaged to one single state increment. To get another type of
    Runge-Kutta scheme, ``steps`` and ``weights`` can be changed.

    Arguments
    ---------
    model : func
        This model function takes a state and returns a new estimated state. The
        returned state should have the same shape as the input state. The model
        should be a time derivative such that it can be integrated. It is
        assumed that the state does not depend on the time itself.
    dt : float, optional
        This is the integration time step. This time step is unitless and
        depends on model's time unit. A positive time step indicates forward
        integration, while a negative shows a backward integration, which might
        be complicated for given model. Default is 0.05.
